- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting needs happened in Module 3 between the Product Owner and the SNHU Travel clients where they communicated by talking about their needs to the Product Owner. The Product Owner was courteous and listened to the clients' needs. User stories helps with communicating needs for projects since they describe the features the client wants to see in the final product. User stories help the development team be able to make important feature come to life.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The first step n developing a program is to talk with the clients about their needs. Next, an outcome for the project should be set so that the team knows where the program should end up. Sprint planning and daily standups/meetings need to happen in order for the team to know what direction to go. Testing and release planning are important too since someone must test the features out and a team must plan on when to release the program to the clients and if future releases will happen down the road. I hope to incorperate Sprint planning along with daily standups since both help with getting your ideas out there to the team and clients.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in development is someone who can communicate well and be dependable. Communication is key in any team since without good and constant communication, the project may not come out correctly. Being dependable is important too since no member of the team should find another member uncapable of being entrusted with a task. This cause everyone stress. Being professional when on a team is also important because who would want to be on a team with someone who uses constant profane language or does not want to cooperate with the team.
